I'm an ML researcher interested in Bayesian inference and generative modeling (``distribution"-centered techniques in general), particularly approaches to these using sampling methods.

I also have a passion for physics (currently: parts of condensed matter physics, QFT and the relations between the two).

I'm currently a PhD student at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) under the supervision of [Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/). Previously I completed my Master's Thesis with [Pascal Poupart](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~ppoupart/), with research focused on Bayesian federated learning methods.
